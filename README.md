# ColorDetectionSystem
This project is a color detection system that identifies the dominant color in an image using computer vision techniques. It uses Python and the OpenCV library to process images and extract the most prominent color.

Features
Detects the dominant color in an image
Displays the RGB values of the detected color
Can process images in various formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)

Usage
To use the color detection system, simply run the ColorDetectionCode.py script with an image file as the input. The script will output the RGB values of the dominant color and display the image with the detected color highlighted.
